            Kulfi is best described as Indian-style ice cream. However, unlike ice cream, kulfi is not churned. 
            This is a fantastic summer dessert. This is a quick and easy version of kulfi. I almost never make kulfi the old way any more.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 liter full-fat milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust according to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch or arrowroot powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Prepare the Milk Mixture:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pan and bring 
                        it to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.</li>
                    <li>
                        Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer the milk, stirring frequently, 
                        until it reduces to about half its original volume. This process may take around 30-40 minutes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add Sugar and Flavorings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the milk has reduced, add the sugar and stir until it dissolves completely.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped nuts, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using), and mix well. Let the mixture simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Thicken the Mixture:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch or arrowroot powder with water to form a smooth paste.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the cornstarch mixture to the simmering milk while stirring continuously. This will help thicken the mixture and give the kulfi a creamy texture.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cool and Pour into Molds:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the mixture has thickened to a custard-like consistency, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into kulfi molds or small individual cups. If using molds, cover them with aluminum foil and insert a popsicle stick into each mold.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Freeze the Kulfi:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the kulfi molds or cups in the freezer and let them freeze for at least 6-8 hours, or until completely set.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Serve and Enjoy:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the kulfi is fully frozen, remove it from the molds by running them under warm water for a few seconds.</li>
                    <li>Serve the Malai Kulfi chilled, garnished with additional chopped nuts or saffron strands if desired.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <span>
            <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>You can customize the flavor of your Malai Kulfi by adding ingredients like rose water, mango pulp, or grated coconut during the cooking process. Experiment with different variations to find your favorite! </p>
