                <h4>Preparation:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash, peel, and grate the carrots.</li>
                    <li>Heat the milk in a heavy-bottomed pan and bring it to a boil.
                         Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer while you prepare the carrots.

                <h4>Cooking Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat ghee in a separate pan or kadhai over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the grated carrots and saut√© for 5-7 minutes until they soften and release their moisture.</li>
                    <li>Pour the simmering milk over the carrots and stir well. Cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, 
                        until the carrots are cooked and the milk reduces to half its original quantity.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add sugar and cardamom powder to the carrot-milk mixture. Stir well and continue cooking until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency.</li>
                    <li>Add chopped nuts and raisins (if using) and mix well. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Finally, add a tablespoon of ghee and mix well. This enhances the flavor and gives the Gajar Halwa a rich aroma.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>serving:</h4>

                    <li>
                        Serve hot or cold, garnished with additional chopped nuts. 
                        Gajar Halwa can be enjoyed on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra indulgent treat.
